# Android Design Patterns

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of design patterns implemented in Kotlin for Android development. The design patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each pattern includes explanations and example code to demonstrate how to implement and use the pattern effectively in an Android application.

## Contents

1. **Creational Patterns**
    - Singleton
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Factory
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory

2. **Structural Patterns**
    - Adapter
    - Decorator
    - Proxy
    - Composite
    - Flyweight
    - Facade
    - Bridge

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Command
    - State
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Iterator
    - Visitor
    - Template Method

4. **Other Patterns**
    - Dependency Injection
    - Repository Pattern

Each pattern's directory contains:
- A detailed `README.md` file explaining:
  - What the pattern is.
  - When to use it.
  - Why to use it.
  - How to use it (with an explanation of the example code).
  - Advantages.
  - Disadvantages.
  - Best Practices.
- Kotlin implementation files demonstrating the pattern.
- Example usage in an Android context.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a reference for Android developers to understand and implement various design patterns. By studying these patterns, developers can improve their code quality, make their applications more robust, and follow best practices in software design.

Feel free to explore the patterns, contribute improvements, and share your own implementations!

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new patterns to add, please create a pull request. Ensure your code follows the Kotlin coding standards and includes proper documentation.
